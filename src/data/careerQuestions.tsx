    title: "Will you let me know when a job has been filled?",
    answer:
      "If you haven’t heard from us in two months about an application, we likely proceeded with other candidates for that particular role. However, our recruiters might reach out if we find a different potential match for your skills, interests, and experience."

    title: "Can I apply for multiple jobs?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can apply for more than one role at once, though we recommend narrowing your choices down to a few jobs that truly match your skills, experience, and interests. We’ll review your resume/CV—and transcript for interns and new graduates—to determine the best fit."

    title: "How many jobs can I apply for?",

    title: "What are the application deadlines?",
    answer:
      "Our job descriptions will include any application deadlines. For most of our openings, we accept applications on a rolling basis, and we encourage you to apply sooner rather than later."
